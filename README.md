# Two Projects:

## Overview

**Bookie** is a simple, clean, and student-friendly platform concept designed to help users search, preview, and access academic resources such as books and notes. Built as a UX case study project, it focuses on solving common frustrations in university content-sharing ecosystems—cluttered results, unclear ownership, and lack of useful context.
**Redesigned Terms and Conditions** to be a user friendly and easy to scan, where design descisions were made by user research.

## 🔧 Project 1: Bookie

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Many academic resource platforms (especially within college circles) provide PDFs or notes in bulk without proper categorization, author tagging, or visual clarity. This causes students to struggle with finding reliable and relevant content.

### 💡 Solution

The Bookie prototype reimagines the typical search and view experience for college students looking for academic materials. It prioritizes:

- Visual clarity through card-based search results
- Useful AI recommendations
- Important details surfaced (author/uploader, tags, downloads)
- A detailed book page with highlights and reviews

---

### 🛠️ Design Flow

1. **User lands on Search Page** with subject filters or general query  
2. **Results shown as structured cards** with:
   - Book cover/image
   - Title
   - Author / Uploader name
   - Tags (subject, semester, type)
   - Download count
3. **Clicking on a card opens the Book Page**, which includes:
   - Full description
   - Key highlights of the book
   - Reviews and ratings from students
   - Download / Preview options

## 📄 Project 2: Terms & Conditions Redesign

Most users skip reading terms and conditions due to overwhelming blocks of text and legal jargon. This micro-UX challenge explores how layout, visuals, and content grouping can increase engagement and trust in the T&C section of digital platforms.
